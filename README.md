👋 Hi, I’m @michaeljelly, co-founder and CEO at Ethi. I do the front-end, design, marketing, whatever needs doing!
👀 I’m interested in hacking together mediocre code to do awesome things, individual autonomy, information flows, AI-alignment, and a load of non-techy stuff too.
🌱 I’m currently learning to make PWA Svelte/Sapper apps, cross-browser extensions, use TailwindCSS, design better, do better data-vis, and marketing
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on giving individuals control of their data and helping them benefit from it
📫 How to reach me: mike@ethi.me
